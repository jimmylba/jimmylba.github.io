    <p class="lead">My long-term research goal is to address a computational question: How can we build general problem-solving machines with human-like efficiency and adaptability? In particular, my research interests focus on the development of efficient learning algorithms for deep neural networks. My research interests overlap with the following research communities: <a href="https://nips.cc/">NeurIPS</a>, <a href="https://iclr.cc/">ICLR</a>, and <a href="https://icml.cc/">ICML</a>. I am also broadly interested in reinforcement learning, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence. </p>

    <p class="lead">Short bio: I completed PhD under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~hinton">Geoffrey Hinton</a>.  Both my master's (2014) and undergrad degrees (2011) are from the University of Toronto under <a href="http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~frey/">Brendan Frey</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/">Ruslan Salakhutdinov</a>. I am a <a href="https://www.cifar.ca/ai/pan-canadian-artificial-intelligence-strategy/the-canada-cifar-ai-chairs">CIFAR AI chair</a>. I was a recipient of the Facebook Graduate Fellowship 2016 in machine learning. </p>
